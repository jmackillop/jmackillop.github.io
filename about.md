<p>I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft. I'm part of the Azure cloud computing division, where I work on designing and implementing cloud-native distributed software. Previously, I worked at Metaswitch Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft for an undisclosed sum in the summer of 2020. I graduated from the maths and statistics undergrad program at Oxford University. </p>

<p>I've got a wide range of interests including data science, software, and econometrics - this site is as of 2020 a work in progress, but my <a href='/projects'> projects</a> page gives a flavour. I'm based in the UK in between Cambridge and London.</p>

<h3>Interested?</h3>
<p>As a matter of policy, I'm always open to new opportunities. If you think we might be a match, please get in touch. The best way to reach out to me is by <a class='u-email' href='mailto:jmackillop@pm.me'>email</a>, but <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmackillop'>linkedin</a> also works. </p>

<p>I get <i>a lot</i> of recruiter traffic from Linkedin - if you are a recruiter, please note the following:
<ul>
<li>A copy of my CV is available on request.</li>
<li>I'm significantly more likely to respond if your first sentence mentions this site.</li>
<li>I'm not interested at this time in roles with compensation less than Â£150,000 p/a - messages not explicitly confirming this will be automatically deleted.</li>
</ul>
